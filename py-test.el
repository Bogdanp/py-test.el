;;; Commentary:

;; py-test gives you the ability to define testing projects and, based
;; on those projects, run a single test that's defined in the current
;; buffer, all of the tests that you have defined in the current buffer,
;; or all of the tests that you have defined in the current buffers's
;; parent directory.

;;; Installation

;; From MELPA:
;;
;; M-x package-install RET py-test RET

;; Manually:

;; Clone the repo:
;;
;; git clone https://github.com/Bogdanp/py-test.el ~/sandbox/py-test.el

;; Add it to your `.emacs`:
;;
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/sandbox/py-test.el"))
;; (require 'py-test)

;;; Usage

;; Define a project.
;;
;; (py-test-define-project
;;  :name "My Project"
;;  :python-command "python"
;;  :base-directory (expand-file-name "~/sandbox/my-project-home/")
;;  :test-runner (expand-file-name "~/sandbox/my-project-home/tests/runner.py")
;;  :working-directory (expand-file-name "~/sandbox/my-project-home/tests/"))

;; Open a file belonging to that project:
;;
;; C-x C-f ~/sandbox/my-project-home/tests/subdirectory/test_something.py RET

;; Run all of the tests that were defined in that file:
;;
;; M-x py-test-run-file RET

;; Run all of the tests that were defined in that file's parent directory:
;;
;; M-x py-test-run-directory RET

;; Jump to a single test function, method or class and run just that:
;;
;; M-x py-test-run-test-at-point RET

;;; Extras

;; `py-test' is also configurable through the following variables (use
;; `describe-variable' for more info):
;;
;;   * py-test-*mode-line-face-shenanigans-on*
;;   * py-test-*mode-line-face-shenanigans-timer*
;;   * py-test-*default-buffer-name*
;;   * py-test-*default-test-runner*
;;   * py-test-*test-path-separator*

;; In addition, `py-test' defines the following faces:
;;
;;   * py-test-*mode-line-green-face*
;;   * py-test-*mode-line-inactive-green-face*
;;   * py-test-*mode-line-red-face*
;;   * py-test-*mode-line-inactive-red-face*
